# Paxmod

Paxmod is a Firefox theme with multiple tab rows and site-dependent tab colors. It provides a straightforward grid-style UI, lets you customize colors and fonts, and add your own custom CSS.

Or tweak it as you like.


## Installation

- Use an up-to-date version (60+) of either [Firefox Developer](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/) or Nightly.

- Allow unsigned extensions. (Go to `about:config` and set `xpinstall.signatures.required` to `false`. [Why?](#why-cant-i-install-paxmod-as-a-verified-extension-through-mozilla))

- Allow legacy extensions. (Go to `about:config` and set `extensions.legacy.enabled` to `true`. This is required to load the bundled stylesheet API.)

- Install Paxmod. (Download the `.xpi` file from [here](https://github.com/numirias/paxmod/releases/latest) and load it in Firefox.)


## Customization

You can change the font, colors and other settings at `about:addons` > *Extensions* > *Paxmod* > *Preferences*.

If you want Paxmod to look exactly the same as in the dark demo, you need the [Terminus font](http://terminus-font.sourceforge.net/). I chose a bitmap font since font rendering in small sizes on dark backgrounds tends to look blurry. But you can set any font you like.

Also, you may want to remove clutter from the toolbar to get a cleaner UI. Open the burger menu (â˜°), click *Customize* and drag away unneeded items (in particular, remove the invisible placeholders to get rid of the empty space). I prefer to keep only the navigation arrows and the download button.

Additionally, disable UI animations for less jiggly tab movement. (Go to `about:config` and set `toolkit.cosmeticAnimations.enabled` to `false`.)

### Custom CSS

You can load a custom CSS file by specifying a path in the settings. If you want to load a local file, make sure you prefix the path with `file://`, e.g. `file:///tmp/foo.css`.

Each color in the settings has a *Var* field where you can specify the name of a CSS variable to get the color from. Then, if your custom CSS file sets these variables, they are automatically applied to the UI. This is useful if you want dynamic UI colors generated by a tool like [pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal). (E.g., you can reference the file `/home/<username>/.cache/wal/colors.css` to directly load the colors generated by wal.)



## FAQ

### Why can't I install Paxmod as a verified extension through Mozilla?

Paxmod needs to be able to modify the browser UI, a feature for which there is no existing WebExtension API, and probably never will be. Therefore, Paxmod relies on an "experimental API" that ships included in the add-on. Unfortunately, this means Mozilla won't sign the extension anymore and therefore it can't be distributed over the official channels.

### Where did the title bar go?

I couldn't find a good and reliable way to integrate an inline title bar into the theme, so it's removed by default. You can re-enable it in the settings, but expect layout glitches. Try using keyboard shortcuts instead. Also, if you think you found a way to integrate the title bar into the theme with pure CSS, feel free to submit a PR.


### How are tab colors calculated?

Each tab color is generated dynamically from the favicon. A dominant color is extracted from the image and eventually adjusted to an appropriate lightness in the [Lab color space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lab_color_space). This works reasonably well and ensures that all tab labels are legible.

## Troubleshooting

### I can't install the add-on.

If Firefox complains that the add-on isn't verified, you probably didn't turn extension signature checks off. Also note that turning the checks off has no effect in the standard releases, which is why you need to use Firefox Developer or Nightly. (Also, if you used a previous version of Paxmod, make sure you uninstall the [Stylesheet API](https://github.com/numirias/stylesheet-api-experiment) which is not required anymore.)

### The design looks off.

Make sure you have all other themes disabled (look under `about:addons` > *Themes*), because some themes might apply aggressive CSS rules that interfere with Paxmod. Also, *Paxmod is mainly tested on Linux*, so there are most likely some design quirks on MacOS or Windows that I'm not aware of. If in doubt, please [file an issue](https://github.com/numirias/paxmod/issues/new). Any help with making Paxmod compatible with other OSes is more than welcome.

### The font looks bad.

Paxmod defaults to the [Terminus font](http://terminus-font.sourceforge.net/) which you can change in the settings.

On Arch Linux, you can install Terminus via:

    # pacman -S terminus-font

### Firefox still doesn't find Terminus.

Make sure you type in the exact name of the font. Some fonts have non-obvious names. (On my machine, Terminus is registered as `xos4 Terminus`, not `Terminus`.) You can list your installed fonts with `fc-list`, e.g.:

    $ fc-list | grep -i terminus
    ...
    /usr/share/fonts/misc/ter-x16b.pcf.gz: xos4 Terminus:style=Bold
    /usr/share/fonts/misc/ter-x14n.pcf.gz: xos4 Terminus:style=Regular
    ...

## Contributing

Use [web-ext](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Getting_started_with_web-ext) to develop locally. After cloning the repository, you can run Paxmod similar to this:

    web-ext run --firefox /usr/bin/firefox-nightly --firefox-profile dev-paxmod --source-dir src

(Make sure the chosen profile has the stylesheet API installed, you're in the project's root directory, and you're pointing to an existing Firefox binary.)

And to build the addon, run:

    web-ext build --overwrite-dest --source-dir src 

This will produce a `.zip` file in `web-ext-artifacts/`. Rename the file to `.xpi` to have it recognized as a Firefox extension.
